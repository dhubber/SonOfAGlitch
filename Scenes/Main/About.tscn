You play as a glitch, in a popular space-themed social-deception game.

Navigate to the multi-color glitches via pipes using the arrow keys.

Once in a glitch, press space to glitch out adjacent tiles, forcing the poor players to find a new route.

Preventing a player from completing their task until the rage bar above their head fills up, will cause them to rage-quit.

If all players rage-quit, you win! However, if they successfully complete their tasks, it's game over.

Good luck!"
