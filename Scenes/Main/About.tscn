You play as a glitch, in a popular space-themed social-deception game.
Navigate to the multi-color glitches via pipes using the arrow keys. Once in a glitch, press space to glitch out adjacent tiles, forcing the poor players to find a new route.
Preventing a player from completing their task until the rage bar above their head fills up, will cause them to rage-quit.
If all players rage-quit, you win! However, if they successfully complete their tasks, it's game over.
Good luck!"
